            Thus by equipping individuals with future technologies, the
            foundation aims at creating a potent workforce, capable of unlocking
            the vast reservoir of untapped potential, in the form of creativity
            and innovation that the youth of the 21st century holds. Choice is
            the greatest luxury one can have; and to exercise that, it is only
            imperative that we arm each and every student with the right options
            to choose. By improving specific learning outcomes, Tinkerhub
            essentially places People First by empowering these individuals with
            technology education and skill sets, to make sustainable choices and
            multi-dimensional solutions, that the complex new world needs.
