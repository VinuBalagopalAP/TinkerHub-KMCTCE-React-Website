            Tinkerhub’s mission is to empower people, whether it be a student or
            a tech-enthusiast, by giving them an opportunity to learn emerging
            technology skill sets which would accelerate innovation within one’s
            learning path, and make them future ready tech-talents. By pursuing
            this mission, the Foundation aims at creating a focussed platform to
            accelerate learning of skills to be on par with the global
            technology ecosystem and the new global workplace. Tinkerhub works
            as a community of enthusiasts that focuses on nurturing co-creation
            and catalysing a technology learning culture through peer-to-peer or
            reciprocal learning.
